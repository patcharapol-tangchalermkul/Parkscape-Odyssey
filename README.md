# Project Summary

_This project was our Year 3 Software Engineering Group Project and won the David Howarth Group Project Prize._

We developed a multiplayer, location-based augmented reality (AR) game designed to blend digital experiences with the physical world. The game encourages outdoor exploration by using mobile devices to interact with AR-enriched environments. Key features include:

  •	Object Recognition Challenges: Players engage with hidden surprises and turn everyday sights into game elements. \
	•	Peer-to-Peer Networking: Utilizes Bluetooth and WiFi-Direct for real-time multiplayer interactions without relying on internet connections. \
	•	Customizable Experience: Includes a web content authoring portal for location managers to tailor gameplay elements and update content in real-time. \
  • Augmented reality (AR) for immersive outdoor exploration \
  • Geolocation Tracking and Adaptive gameplay

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for distributed offline networking and machine learning integration in mobile devices, enhancing physical and digital interaction.
